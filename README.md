# Retail-Sales-Store-Analysis | Revenue, Trends and Insights
Excel Project | Retail Sales Data | From Raw Data to Business Insights

### Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes sales data from a retail store to uncover key business insights. The main goal is to understand sales performance trends, identify top-performing products, and create a visually appealing Excel dashboard that summarizes these insights for decision-making.

Using Microsoft Excel, the dataset is cleaned and prepared to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key analyses include exploring total sales over time, comparing product categories, and highlighting the highest revenue-generating products. The final dashboard provides an interactive view of sales trends, product performance, and profitability metrics, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven business decisions.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world sales data — showcasing practical skills in Excel functions, data visualization, and dashboard creation relevant to business analytics.
